                 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
                 
This is a personal project aimed at understanding various supervised models to solve both classification and regression problems. The goal of this project is to predict medical insurance costs based on patient information. The data used in this project is sourced from the https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance dataset.

                          Models Used
                          
In this project, I have experimented with several supervised models, including linear regression, random forest regressor, and XGBRegressor, to find the best solution for this problem. I have chosen these models because they are commonly used in regression tasks and are known to work well with this type of data.

                                   Results
                                   
The results of my experiments show that the XGBRegressor model performed the best with an accuracy of 86.70%. Through exploring the feature importances, I discovered that the patient's age and BMI had the most impact on the insurance costs.

                           Running the Code
                           
To run the code, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following packages installed: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc. Once you have those, you can clone the repository and run the 'main.py' file.
